# Calculating-Polynomial-Coefficients-from-P-1-and-P-P-1-
This script calculates the coefficients of a polynomial given P(1) and P(P(1)) using integer division. The polynomial must be single variable, with natural number coefficients and degree, it should not be a monomial, and P(1) should not be equal to P(P(1)).
